# Files and Folders

These are some of the config files and dot files which I use daily

All the `scripts` are in `~/.local/bin/.scripts`

Currently using [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as my primary
window manager.

`Binary Space Partitioning Window Mangager(bspwm)` as name suggests, this is
a binary space partitioning tiling wm which supports _spiral,alternative_ and
some other partitioning mechanisms.

Also, `sxhkd` is a must with bspwm as it binds the keys to different commands.
